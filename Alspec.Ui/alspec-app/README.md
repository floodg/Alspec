# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the React application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (if preferred)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [React Developer Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) (optional but helpful)

---

## Set Up the React Application

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-app.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder and install the dependencies. You can use either npm or Yarn for this.

**Using npm:**

```bash
cd your-react-app
npm install
```

**Using Yarn:**

```bash
cd your-react-app
yarn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies for the React project.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (if applicable)

If your application uses environment variables (such as API keys, URLs, etc.), create a `.env` file in the root of the project. For example:

```ini
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:5001/api
```

Make sure to replace `REACT_APP_API_URL` with the actual environment variable names that your application requires. These variables can be accessed in the code using `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`.

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Development Server

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the environment, you can start the development server.

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm start
```

**Using Yarn:**

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser, typically at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Building the Application for Production

To create an optimized production build of your React application, run the following command:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Using Yarn:**

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `build/` directory with all the optimized files for deployment.

---

## Testing the Application

To run the tests for the React application, follow these steps:

1. **Run Unit and Integration Tests:**

   If you have set up testing (e.g., with Jest), you can run tests by using the following command:

   **Using npm:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   **Using Yarn:**

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

   This will run the tests, and you will see results in the terminal or a browser-based test runner.

2. **Run the End-to-End Tests (if applicable):**

   If you're using tools like Cypress or Selenium for E2E testing, follow the documentation for that tool to run the tests.

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the React application, here are some common solutions:

- **Issue: `npm start` or `yarn start` command doesn't work.**
  - Ensure that Node.js and npm (or Yarn) are installed and up to date.
  - Check if there are any errors in the terminal when running the command and fix them accordingly.

- **Issue: CORS errors when making API calls.**
  - Ensure that the API server is running and accessible.
  - If you're running the React application and API on different ports, configure CORS on the API server to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`.
  
  In the API's CORS configuration (for example, in ASP.NET Core), you can add:

  ```csharp
  services.AddCors(options =>
  {
      options.AddPolicy("AllowReactApp", builder =>
          builder.WithOrigins("http://localhost:3000")
                 .AllowAnyMethod()
                 .AllowAnyHeader());
  });
  ```

  Then, apply this policy in the `Configure` method:

  ```csharp
  app.UseCors("AllowReactApp");
  ```

- **Issue: API not fetching data or showing errors in the console.**
  - Check if the API server is running and accessible.
  - Verify the API URL in the `.env` file and ensure it matches the correct API endpoint.
  - Look for errors in the browser's Developer Tools Console for more details.

- **Issue: Slow build or development server.**
  - Make sure you're not running unnecessary processes that could be using up system resources.
  - If the problem persists, try cleaning the npm or Yarn cache with:

    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

    Or for Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn cache clean
    ```
